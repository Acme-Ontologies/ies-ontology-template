= Just Recipes for IES Projects

This directory contains shared https://just.systems/[just] command runner recipes used across IES projects.

== Files

`common.just`:: Common recipes shared across all IES projects

== Usage

To use these recipes in your project, add an import line to your project's `justfile`:

[source]
----
import 'tools/ies-tools/just/common.just'
----

This will make all recipes from `common.just` available in your project.

You can override any imported recipe by defining it locally in your project's `justfile`, and add additional project-specific recipes as needed.

== Adding New Recipes

When adding new recipes to `common.just`:

1. Ensure the recipe is truly common across projects
2. Add clear comments explaining the recipe's purpose
3. Use variables where values might need to be customized
4. Test the recipe in at least one consuming project before committing

See the just command runner https://just.systems/man/en/[manual] for detailed documentation on writing recipes.
