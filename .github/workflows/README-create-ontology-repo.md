# Create Repository from Template Workflow

⚠️ **WARNING**: This workflow should only be executed from the `ies-ontology-template` repository. Do not attempt to run it from ontology repositories that were created using this workflow, as it may lead to unexpected results.

## Overview

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the process of creating new ontology repositories from the `ies-ontology-template` template. It performs the following tasks:

1. Creates a new repository from the template
2. Sets up a standard set of repository labels for issue tracking
3. Creates a GitHub Project for the new repository
4. Links the Project to the repository
5. Sets up the PROJECT_ID as a repository variable

## Usage

The workflow can be triggered manually from the Actions tab of the `ies-ontology-template` repository. You will need to provide:

- Repository name
- Repository description
- Public/Private status (defaults to private)

## Required Permissions

### Organization PAT Requirements

The `ACME_ONTOLOGIES_PAT` (Personal Access Token) needs the following permissions:

- `repo` - Full control of private repositories
  - Needed for creating repositories and managing their settings
- `workflow` - Update GitHub Action workflows
  - Required for setting up repository variables
- `admin:org` - Full control of orgs and teams
  - Needed for creating and managing projects
- `project` - Full control of organization projects
  - Required for creating and configuring projects

### Workflow Permissions

The workflow itself requires:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write    # For creating repository content
  pull-requests: write   # For potential future PR creation features
```

## Maintenance Considerations

### Token Management
- Ensure the `ACME_ONTOLOGIES_PAT` token doesn't expire
- Regularly audit token permissions
- Have a process for token rotation

### Error Handling
The workflow includes error handling for:
- Project creation
- Variable setting
- Repository creation

Failed steps will output relevant information to the workflow logs for debugging.

### Template Updates
When updating the template repository:
- Test the workflow after significant changes
- Ensure new template features don't break the repository creation process
- Update workflow permissions if new features require additional access

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. Permission Errors
   - Verify PAT permissions
   - Check organization membership roles
   - Ensure PAT hasn't expired

2. Variable Creation Failures
   - Check workflow logs for specific error messages
   - Verify repository settings allow variable creation
   - Ensure PAT has correct scope

3. Project Creation Issues
   - Verify organization project settings
   - Check project quota limits
   - Ensure project templates (if used) exist

## Standard Labels

The workflow automatically creates a standard set of labels in each new repository:

| Label              | Description                                | Color   |
