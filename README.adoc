* `.github/` - GitHub workflows and issue templates
* `assets/` - Project assets like images and logos
* `build/` - Build artifacts and outputs
* `docs/` - Project documentation
** `diagrams/` - Ontology diagrams and visualizations
** `exemplars/` - Example usage and patterns
** `specifications/` - Formal specifications
* `imports/` - Imported ontologies and dependencies
* `src/` - Source files
** `competencies/` - Competency questions in SPARQL
** `data/` - Source data files
** `ontology/` - Ontology source files
* `tests/` - Test suites
** `integration/` - Integration tests
** `unit/` - Unit tests
** `validation/` - Validation tests and shapes
* `ies-tools/` - Development tools

== Initial Setup
Follow these steps to set up a new ontology repository:

1. Create a new (domain) ontology development repository from the IES Ontology template (link:https://github.com/Acme-Ontologies/ies-ontology-template/generate[IES Ontology Template]). See the link:.github/README.md[.gitHub README.md] for detailed information about available workflows and templates.

2. Set up poetry / Python environment for ies-tools:
+
[source,bash]
----
poetry install
----
3. Verify poetry setup:
+
[source,bash]
----
poetry run gh-tool --help
----

If all is well, you should see the help output for the `gh-tool` command.

== Development GitHub Workflows

=== Creating Issues
Use the provided tools to create standardized issues:

[source,bash]
----
# Create a feature request
poetry run gh-tool create-feature

# Create a bug report
poetry run gh-tool create-bug

# Create a documentation task
poetry run gh-tool create-docs-task
----

=== Pull Requests
Create pull requests using the provided tool:

[source,bash]
----
poetry run gh-tool create-pr
----

=== Updating GitHub workflows and IES Tools
The special GitHub workflow `sync-tools.yml` is scheduled to run daily to update the common IES workflows and tools from the [IES Ontology Template](https://github.com/Acme-Ontologies/ies-ontology-template).
When updates are available, a PR will be created ready to be reviewed and merged into the local repository.

Alterntively, the workflow can be triggered manually by running the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
# Fetch latest tool changes from the IES Ontology Template
poetry run sync-tools
----

If there are updates, review the new PR and merge it into the local repository.
