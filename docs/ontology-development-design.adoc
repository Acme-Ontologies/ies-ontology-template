== Project Overview

=== ToDo

  - [ ] Add DOCUMENT_ID and DOCUMENT_DRAFT_STATUS_ID to project secrets
  - [ ] Note to add the `ACME-ONTOLOGIES-PAT` token as a repo secret for each domain ontology repo
  - [ ] Add ies-core as submodule to all domain ontologies; can it be done automatically? Or using a one-off workflow or just script (yes, use a just script to add the submodule)
  - [ ] Make issue-feature work in a domain ontology repo
  - [ ] Make issue-bug work in a domain ontology repo
  - [ ] Make issue-doc work in a domain ontology repo
  - [ ] Make ontology-qa-review work in a domain ontology repo
  - [ ] Make ontology-release-candidate work in a domain ontology repo
  - [ ] Make ontology-validation work in a domain ontology repo
  - [ ] Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file to the domain ontology repo
  - [ ] Create the CHANGELOG.md file, as example

  - [ ] Add Crown copyright notice to the LICENSE file

=== Purpose and Scope
This ontology aims to provide a standardized vocabulary for the domain. It covers key concepts and relationships.

=== Target Users/Stakeholders
